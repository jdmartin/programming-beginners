# General Programming

This is a collection of general resources on programming.

EdX, [Harvard CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) - If you want a solid introduction to the computing concepts that will underlie all these languages, then this is the place for you.  The best programming course I’ve ever seen.

[Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/) - Generally well constructed collection of articles on specific programming tasks and environments relevant to Digital Humanities work.

EdX, [Introduction to Linux](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-0#.U9sOzIBdVd8) - So much of programming derives from C.  So does Linux.  Not a coincidence… Come to the Dark Side, we have cookies.

[Learn Regex the Hard Way](http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/book/) - Embrace the Old Ways, and learn the best search tool ever.

[Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com) - Fast, somewhat dense introductions to a variety of languages and related concepts. Possibly most useful for a quick review of past study.

[What is Code?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) - Fantastic look at code and coding.
