Hi Everyone,

This is really meant to be a way to consolidate useful links for learning programming.  So, if you've got something you'd really like to share, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.  (I'll come up with a clever way to show who suggested what... maybe  "thing -- (contributed: person)?"

Thanks, and happy programming! :)

~Jon
