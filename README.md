A list of resources for learning programming in various languages (work in progress)

Hi Everyone,

Given a number of the discussions I've had with friends and students, I thought I would draw up this list of programming resources for use in your future study.  It's really just a beginning, and I'm sure it can use lots of work. As such, I would love to include your suggestions as well.  As ever, you can reach me on Twitter ([@songsthatsaved](https://twitter.com/songsthatsaved)). 

Cheers,
Jon (aka StandardHumanUnit)
