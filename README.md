A list of resources for learning programming in various languages (work in progress)

Hi Everyone,

Given a number of the discussions I've had with friends and students, I thought I would draw up this list of programming resources for use in your future study.  It's really just a beginning, and I'm sure it can use lots of work.  I've broken each topic or language into its own .md file for ease of organizing, and the links to each are below.  I would love to include your suggestions as well.  As ever, you can reach me on Twitter ([@songsthatsaved](https://twitter.com/songsthatsaved)).

Cheers,
Jon (aka StandardHumanUnit)
